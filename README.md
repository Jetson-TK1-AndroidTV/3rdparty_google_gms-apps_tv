License
The Open GApps Project itself is licensed under the GPLv3 with an addendum called the Open GApps installable zip exception. A short explanation of these license terms and the terms used by the pre-built OpenGApps.org packages:

The license and its exception are very comparable to the GNU Compiler Collection.
The Open GApps Project itself is like a "compiler" that is licensed under the GPLv3.
The "Installable zips" produced by the Open GApps Project is a assorted product of which its components adhere to various different licenses. E.g. the Open GApps installer scripts are still GPLv3 licensed.
The author of an "installable zip" can choose the license for this assorted end-product themselves, as long as any changes to the version of The Open GApps Project compiler used during the creation of the "installable zip" are published under the GPLv3 with the "installable zip" too. Also the individual components within the "installable zip" are still licensed under their respective terms.
The pre-built packages from OpenGApps.org are made available under the terms that they can be freely used for personal use only, and are not allowed to be mirrored to the public other than OpenGApps.org
